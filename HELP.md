## Generic TCP and UDP module

A generic module for performing simple TCP and UDP requests

If you are using this plugin, 
then it would probably mean that you are using some software that has not been supported yet, 
and we would therefore really appreciate if you made a module request for it here:

https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-requests/issues

In that way, more people will get to benefit from this in the future, thanks. 

**Available commands in this module**

* Send TCP
* Send UDP
