## Middle Control Companion Plugin

Official plugin to control Middle Control software using Companion, which in turns controls Blackmagic cameras and even DJI gimbals through the APC or APC-R. It can run on the same device that runs Middle Control, or on a remote device on the same network.

Please note that :

- Middle Control software has to be running (locally on this computer or on any computer on this network) </li>
- Middle Control software has to be connected to your ATEM if you have one</li>
- In order to control gimbal movements you will need to use an APC or APC-R</li>

You can report issues here :

In that way, more people will get to benefit from this in the future, thanks.
