## Middle Control Companion Plugin

Official plugin to control Middle Control software using Companion, which allows you to control Blackmagic Cameras. And also DJI gimbals if you have an APC or APC-R. It can run on the same device that runs Middle Control, or on a remote device on the same network.

Instructions & ready to go Companion pages here : https://www.middlethings.co/companion

Please note that :

- Middle Control software has to be running (locally on this computer or on any computer on this network) </li>
- Middle Control software has to be connected to your ATEM if you have one</li>
- In order to control gimbal movements you will need to use an APC or APC-R</li>
